# Angene

(pronounced 'engine')
I don't really have a proper sketch for this engine, just playing around and seeing what I can make out of it.
Python folder contains a library called Angene, deprecated and not supported over the C# counterpart.

C# library has proper functionality and is maintained. For more information refer to CS/README.md.
